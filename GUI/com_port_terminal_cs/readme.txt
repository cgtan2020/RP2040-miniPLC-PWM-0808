  //  com_port_terminal 
        //  Visual C# .NET application. Created with Visual Studio 2008.
        //  Converted from Visual Basic with C Sharpener for VB (www.elegancetech.com)
        
        //  Demonstrates communications using .NET 2.0's SerialPort class
        //  Displays a text box where users can enter text to send to a COM port 
        //  and view text received from a COM port.
        //  The user can select a COM port, bit rate, and handshaking.
        //  A ToolStripStatusLabel displays the current port settings.
        //  A second text box displays error messages and other information.
        
        //  The COM port can be any RS-232 port, including USB/RS-232 converters
        //  or another device (such as FTDI FT245BM) that uses COM-port drivers on the PC.
        
        //  The ComPorts class stores information about the system's COM ports
        //  and enables accessing them.
        
        //  The PortSettingsDialog dialog box displays the system's ports and updates 
        //  as needed to display the currently attached ports.
        
        //  If there are no COM ports, the application searches for new ports and selects
        //  one when attached.
        
        //  User preferences are stored in the registry and retrieved when the application runs.
        
        //  To connect two RS-232 ports on the same PC or different PCs, 
        //  use a null-modem cable. (Cross-connect RXD to TXD, RTS to CTS, DTR to DSR.)
        
        //  Each COM port can be controlled by an instance of this application, or one of the ports 
        //  can be controlled by Windows Hyperterminal or another application.
        
        //  Created using Visual C# 2005 Express (free download from Microsoft).

        //  Known issues:

        //  For unknown reasons, the ToolStripStatusLabel at the bottom of the form
        //  occasionally truncates to a few characters wide or less and you need to
        //  restart the application to restore it. Advice welcome on this issue.

        // Physically removing a USB virtual COM port with an open handle 
        // can terminate the application with the following error:

        // System.ObjectDisposedException was unhandled
        // Message="Safe handle has been closed"
        // at Microsoft.Win32.UnsafeNativeMethods.WaitCommEvent.

        // Application.ThreadException doesn't catch this exception.
        // AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException can detect the exception but terminates the application. 
        // Thus, users should avoid removing virtual COM ports that are in use.
